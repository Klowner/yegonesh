ye*go*nesh
==========

a small wrapper around `dmenu` with a sense of history, basically a reimplementation of [yeganesh](http://dmwit.com/yeganesh) except written in [Go](http://golang.org/)

Usage
-----
Currently there are no options, if you'd like to pass arguments to `dmenu` then append them after `yegonesh --`. eg: `yegonesh -- -fn glisp-7`.
